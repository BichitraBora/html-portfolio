<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Bichitra Bora, and I am a BCA student at a college affiliated with Dibrugarh University. I enjoy exploring new creative pursuits, including video editing and writing, and I strive to express myself better, particularly in English, to connect with people from different cultures. I am focused on enhancing my web development skills through projects like a Spotify clone and foundational website structures. I aim to excel in both technical and personal growth, working towards building confidence, improving communication skills, and pursuing a charming and confident personality. Balancing studies with creativity, I am also exploring ways to use AI tools effectively for learning and personal development.</p>
